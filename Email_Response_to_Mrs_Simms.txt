Subject: Parent Login Credentials - Classroom Management App

Hello Mrs. Simms,

Good evening! I'm so glad the Principal approved the newsletter app! Here are the parent login credentials:

APP URL:
https://classroom-management-app-wca.streamlit.app

PARENT LOGIN CREDENTIALS (Test Accounts):
Currently, there are 3 test parent accounts set up. You can use these for testing:

Account 1:
- Username: parent1
- Password: password123
- Email: parent1@email.com

Account 2:
- Username: parent2
- Password: password123
- Email: parent2@email.com

Account 3:
- Username: parent3
- Password: password123
- Email: parent3@email.com

YOUR TEACHER LOGIN:
- Username: mrs.simms
- Password: password123

HOW TO SEND NEWSLETTERS TO PARENTS:
1. Log in as teacher (mrs.simms / password123)
2. Go to "Newsletter Management"
3. Click "ðŸ“§ Send Email" on any newsletter
4. Enter your email configuration
5. Click "ðŸ“§ Send Email" - it will send to all parents with email addresses

ADDING REAL PARENT ACCOUNTS:
For your actual class parents, I can help you add them. We'll need:
- Parent name
- Parent email address
- Parent phone number (optional)
- Student name (to link parent to child)

Would you like me to:
1. Create individual accounts for each of your class parents?
2. Or would you prefer a self-registration system where parents can sign up themselves?

Please let me know which option works best, and I'll set that up for you!

For now, you can use the test accounts (parent1, parent2, parent3) to:
- Test the newsletter email functionality
- Show parents how the app works
- Practice sending newsletters

If you have any questions or need help, just let me know!

Best regards,
Mr. Kola
