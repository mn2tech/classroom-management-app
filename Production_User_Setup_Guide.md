# Production User Setup Guide

## 🎯 **Demo vs Production Accounts**

### **Current Demo Accounts** (For Testing Only)
- **Teacher**: `mrs.simms` / `password123`
- **Parents**: `parent1`, `parent2`, `parent3` / `password123`

## 🔒 **Best Practices for Production**

### **Username Guidelines**
- Use unique, identifiable usernames
- Examples:
  - `smith.family`
  - `john.smith`
  - `jane.doe.parent`
- Avoid generic names like `parent1`, `parent2`

### **Password Guidelines**
- Create strong, unique passwords for each parent
- Consider using a password pattern:
  - Example: `WCA2024_[FirstName]`
  - Or generate random passwords and securely share them

### **Security Notes**
- ⚠️ Demo accounts (`parent1`, `parent2`, `parent3`) should be deleted before production
- ⚠️ Each parent should have their own unique account
- ⚠️ Share credentials securely (email, phone, or in-person)
- ⚠️ Store parent credentials securely for your records
