👥 HOW PARENTS CAN ACCESS THE APP:

Simply send parents this message (see template below) with their login credentials. Parents can then:
1. Click the link above
2. Login with their username and password
3. View newsletters, their child's progress, events, and assignments
4. Download PDF newsletters
5. RSVP to events

🔐 YOUR TEACHER LOGIN:
- Username: mrs.simms
- Password: password123

📧 TEMPLATE MESSAGE TO SEND TO PARENTS:

"Dear Parents,

I'm excited to share our new Classroom Management App! You can now easily access:
- Weekly newsletters
- Your child's progress and assignments
- Upcoming events and RSVPs
- Important announcements

To access the app:
1. Go to: https://classroom-management-app-wca.streamlit.app
2. Login with your credentials:
   - Username: [parent username]
   - Password: [parent password]

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!

📋 CURRENT TEST ACCOUNTS:
For now, you have 3 test parent accounts you can share for testing:
- Username: parent1 / Password: password123
- Username: parent2 / Password: password123  
- Username: parent3 / Password: password123

✨ ADDING REAL PARENT ACCOUNTS:
To add your actual class parents, I'll need:
- Parent's full name
- Parent's email address
- Phone number (optional)
- Student name (to link parent to child)

I can create individual accounts for each parent, or we can set up a self-registration system. Let me know which you prefer!

📚 NEWSletters:
Once parents log in, they can:
- View all newsletters you've created
- Download PDF versions
- See newsletters anytime they want
- No need to send emails - they just check the app!

If you have any questions or need help, just let me know!

Best regards,
Mr. Kola
